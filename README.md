# webpack-bin
A webpack code sandbox

### info
The session has an "in memory" webpack instance on the server allowing for all loaders and npm packages to be loaded. Superfast rebundling is also supported

Will currently need a fork of Babel loader due to how presets and plugins are loaded. Also project is now proxied with Kotatsu, so need to copy cookie. Created issue for adding that feature.
