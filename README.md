# webpack-bin
A webpack code sandbox

### Requirements
Node v5, NPM v3 and MongoDB

### Start
1. `npm install`
2. Change your hosts file and add `www.webpackbin.dev`
3. `npm start`
4. Open up `www.webpackbin.dev:3000` in your browser
5. 

### NPM Extractor
WebpackBin depends on [npm-extractor](https://github.com/christianalfoni/npm-extractor). Just clone it and run it :-)

### Want to add a boilerplate?
1. Create a new BIN
2. Code the boilerplate
3. Create an issue with the URL of the BIN
4. We will update it on next release

This process will be simplified with further implementations

### Want to contribute?
1. Create a pull request pointing to an issue (if any)

The project does not currently have any tests, so this is subject to change when the project stabilizes.
